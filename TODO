Easy

- dynamic tile colouring - no manually colouring different tiles (shading can be automated too)
- dynamic tile rendering (arbitrary width and height)
- water tiles move up and down like waves (nice effect)
- fix WASD water highlighting (mouse selection work broke it)
- city view ui
- allocate resources
- building process should factor in citizens and usage elsewhere
    - i.e two adjacent constructions to one city should receive half progress
- monolith spawns
- BALLS BALLS BALLS functionality
- dynamic tile heights (render sides behind first scale and render line and flats behind) - DONE

Medium
- auto assign jobs/roles
- births

Hard
- tile shadows
